The application [provide a concise overview of the project's objective, purpose, or problem it solves]. It's built to leverage the strengths of Next.js for server-side rendering, MongoDB for data storage, and Apollo for managing GraphQL queries and mutations.

# Key Features
## Authentication: Implementation of [specify the authentication method used, e.g., JWT tokens] for secure user access throughout the application.
## Middleware: Custom middleware operations handle [describe middleware functionalities such as logging, error handling, etc.] to streamline request processing.

# Technologies Utilized
## Next.js: Employs server-side rendering and efficient routing for the frontend.
## MongoDB: Serves as the NoSQL database for storing application data.
## Apollo Client: Manages GraphQL queries, state management, and UI updates in the frontend.
## Apollo Server: Handles GraphQL queries, mutations, and interactions with the database.
